## Requirements

- A TeamCity server (d'uh)
- A Windows Server with IIS to host the web application, or your Windows dev machine if you just want to try it out.
- Some knowledge on how to add a .NET web application in IIS, or the willingness to learn.
- A nice cup of coffee to drink while you install this. 

## Installation instructions

### Windows IIS

1. Ensure you have [.NET Core Windows Server Hosting Bundle](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/publishing/iis?tabs=aspnetcore1x) and [.NET Core 1.1.x Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core#/runtime) installed 
2. Download and unzip the [the latest release](https://github.com/amoerie/teamcity-theatre/releases)
3. Add the following to the `appsettings.json` file:

```
  "Connection": {
    "Url": "http://your-teamcity-server/",
    "Username": "your-teamcity-username",
    "Password": "your-teamcity-password"
  }
```

4. (Optional) Change the location of the configuration.json file or leave the default
5. Install this folder as a web application in IIS:
  - Application pool should use .NET CLR version 'No Managed Code'
  - Application pool should use Managed Pipeline mode 'Integrated'
  
## Usage instructions

Open the web application from a browser
  - Make sure that you type the URL in lowercase
  - Open the settings page from the main menu. 
    - If you see any errors, your server or credentials might be incorrect. Check in the developer tools why the network request failed.
  - Add a new view, give it a name.
  - Expand your TeamCity projects in the left bottom pane and select one to see its build configurations.
  - Add build configurations to your view. These will become the tiles of your view.
  - Open the dashboard from the main menu and select your view
  - Wait for the data to load. 
  - Enjoy.

## Compilation instructions

1. Ensure you have [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) installed
2. Ensure you have [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed
3. Execute "publish.cmd" or "publish.sh" (.cmd for Windows)
4. If all goes well, that should create a folder 'publish-output' which is all you need to host the application. See Installation instructions from here.
